### Powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, this smart TV turned virtual window features the following:

* Display real-time live feeds from any RTSP-enabled camera (yours or any other)
* Display scenic video loops (e.g. beach, mountains, waterfall, etc.)
* Control the feeds or video via local button control or via MQTT/Home Assistant
* Removable cross-grid (muntin or mullion or whatever you call them), allows use as a regular smart TV when not in "window mode"

#### Full build instructions, parts list and more can be found on the Resinchem Tech Blog.

#### Details on installation of the software, button use and MQTT commands can be found in the wiki.
